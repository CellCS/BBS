functions 1 Details on members: POWON ID, password, other personal information such as address, exter- nal email address, DOB, date of joining POWON (anniversary date), record of membership fees paid(date, amount). etc. Members have family, friends and colleagues, privilege and status. A member can specify what part of his/her personal information is accessible to other members of POWON and what part is accessible to which members of his/her group or is private.Each member can only have one pro?le including one email address.

2 A new person can become a member by entering his details and validate it by entering the valid email address, DOB and ?rst name of an existing member or by being introduced to the system by an existing member. Non-members are allowed access to the public information posted by the administrator of the system: such public information is visible to all members as well.

3 Privilege can be either administrator or member. A user with the administrator privilege has the full capability on all services such as creation, deletion, editing of members and groups. The administrator could also post public items.

4 A member can create new groups, post new items in the web-page hierarchies for the group and specify which of the members of a group can access which of these pages, who can comment on what or where content could be added. The group pages are not accessible to anyone other than the group members. Membership of a group is visible to all members of the group and they can send private communication or comments to another member in the group. NO access is allowed to anyone outside the list of members of a group.

5 Status of a member can be either active, inactive or suspended. An active member can have access to all the functionalities of a member. An inactive member will not be visible to other members; nor would communication be sent to an inactive member. A suspended member will not be able to lo-gin to the POWON system until his/her status is changed.

6 Only a member with an administrator privilege can change the privilege of another member. The system by default has one member with user-name admin and password admin created initially(Both of these must be changed after the ?rst lo-gin). Only members with administrator privileges can change the status of other members to suspended or reset it to active or inactive.

7 When installed on a real server, POWON can send out email messages to indicate new contents to the members of the associated group. However, since there is a restriction of sending emails by AITS (No email messages are allowed to be sent out of the system), emails have to be simulated by a pop-up window and internal inbox and ¡¯sent email¡¯ box. Hence a member can consult these internal boxes at any time.

8 Details about groups: Records of information on each group, owner of the group, list of members belonging to the group. Owner of the group can add new members or remove members from the group. Members of a group can share a forum of information such as photos, videos and posts. Adding any member into a group requires the knowledge of the person¡¯s POWON ID, email address, ?rst name and DOB.

9 Each member has a home page which has an email facility, index of his/her contents as well as the contents of each of the groups where he is an ¡¯owner¡¯ or member. The group owner has a feature to view and manage the permissions to any content; the permissions can be changed only by the owner.

10 Detail on contents and the permissions: Each content added by a member can have a pro?le which indicates who can do what with it. Content can be classi?ed as view only, view and comment or view and add or link to other contents.
